# weather-dashboard

## Description

- The aim of this project is provide a dashboard that searches for the weather both for today and the next 5 days using an API. I have chosen to use the OpenWeatherMap API to provide the data and icons for the weather results.

- Users can both search for a new city or search for a city that has already been searched for from the corresponding button for that city in the search history
